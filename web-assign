Q.1 What’s difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous?
Synchronous and asynchronous are two different modes of operation that describe how tasks are executed and how control flows between different parts of a program.

1. Synchronous:
In synchronous execution, tasks are performed one after the other in a sequential manner. 
Synchronous execution follows a sequential order and blocks the program until each task completes.
Synchronous execution is suitable when tasks depend on each other and need to be executed in a specific order.
When a synchronous task is executed, the program waits until that task is completed before moving on to the next task. 
This means that each task blocks the execution of the program until it finishes.

2. Asynchronous:
In asynchronous execution, tasks can be started and completed independently of each other. 
Asynchronous execution allows tasks to be started and completed independently, without blocking the program.
When an asynchronous task is executed, the program does not wait for that task to complete before moving on to the next task. 
Instead, it continues executing the next tasks in parallel or simply proceeds with its own execution.
Asynchronous execution is useful when tasks can be executed concurrently or when responsiveness is required, such as handling user input or making network requests.

Q.2 What are Web Apis ?
Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other over the internet.
They define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.
Web APIs can serve different purposes, including:

Retrieving data: APIs can be used to fetch data from remote servers, such as retrieving weather information, stock prices, or user data from a database.
Sending data: APIs allow applications to send data to remote servers, such as submitting a form, posting a comment, or uploading a file.
Performing actions: APIs can provide methods for performing specific actions, such as creating, updating, or deleting resources on a server.

Web APIs are typically based on HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and use standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., to communicate with the server.
They usually exchange data in formats like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (eXtensible Markup Language).

Q.3 Explain SetTimeOut and setInterval ?
setTimeout and setInterval are JavaScript functions used for scheduling the execution of code at specific time intervals. 
1. setTimeout:
   - The setTimeou` function allows you to schedule the execution of a function or a code snippet after a specified delay.
   - Syntax: `setTimeout(function, delay, arg1, arg2, ...)`
   - Parameters:
     - function: The function or code snippet to be executed.
     - delay: The delay (in milliseconds) before executing the function.
     - arg1, arg2, ...: Optional arguments to be passed to the function.

   - Example:

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log("Delayed code executed!");
     }, 2000); // Executes after 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds)
   
    The setTimeout function returns a timer ID that can be used to cancel the execution using the clearTimeout function.

2. setInterval:
   - The setIntervalfunction allows you to repeatedly execute a function or a code snippet at a specified interval.
   - Syntax: setInterval(function, delay, arg1, arg2, ...)
   - Parameters:
     - function: The function or code snippet to be executed.
     - delay: The time interval (in milliseconds) between each execution of the function.
     - arg1, arg2, ...: Optional arguments to be passed to the function.
   - Example :

     let counter = 0;
     let intervalId = setInterval(() => {
       console.log("Interval code executed!", counter);
       counter++;
       if (counter >= 5) {
         clearInterval(intervalId); // Stops the interval after 5 executions
       }
     }, 1000); // Executes every 1000 milliseconds (1 second)


The setInterval`function returns an interval ID that can be used to cancel the interval using the `clearInterval` function.

Q.4 how can you handle Async code in JavaScript ?
In JavaScript, asynchronous code can be handled using various techniques to ensure proper execution and avoid blocking the program.

Callbacks:
Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to asynchronous functions. They are called once the asynchronous operation is completed.
Example:
function fetchData(callback) {
  // Simulating an asynchronous operation
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = "Some data";
    callback(data);
  }, 2000);
}

fetchData((data) => {
  console.log(data); // Handle the data once fetched
});

Promises:
Promises provide a more structured way to handle asynchronous code. They represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and allow chaining of multiple operations.
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulating an asynchronous operation
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = "Some data";
      resolve(data);
    }, 2000);
  });
}

fetchData()
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data); // Handle the resolved data
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error); // Handle any errors
  });

Async/Await:
Async/await is a modern syntax introduced in ES2017 (ES8) that provides a more synchronous style of writing asynchronous code using promises.
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulating an asynchronous operation
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = "Some data";
      resolve(data);
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function fetchDataAsync() {
  try {
    const data = await fetchData();
    console.log(data); // Handle the resolved data
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error); // Handle any errors
  }
}

fetchDataAsync();

###############################################################################################
Q.5 What are Callbacks &  Callback Hell ?
Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are invoked after the completion of a certain task or event.
Callbacks are commonly used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from a server or executing code after a timer expires.
Example:
function fetchData(callback) {
  // Simulating an asynchronous operation
  setTimeout(() => {
    const data = "Some data";
    callback(data);
  }, 2000);
}

fetchData((data) => {
  console.log(data); // Handle the data once fetched
});

Callback Hell, also known as the Pyramid of Doom, is a term used to describe a situation where multiple nested callbacks are used, leading to complex and hard-to-read code.
It occurs when asynchronous operations depend on each other or need to be executed in a specific sequence. 
Each nested callback is dependent on the previous one, and as more operations are added, the code becomes deeply nested and difficult to maintain.
asyncOperation1(function (result1) {
  // Handle result1
  asyncOperation2(function (result2) {
    // Handle result2
    asyncOperation3(function (result3) {
      // Handle result3
      asyncOperation4(function (result4) {
        // Handle result4
        // ... and so on
      });
    });
  });
});

Q.6 What are Promises & Explain Some Three Methods of Promise
Promises are JavaScript objects used for handling asynchronous operations and representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous task.
They provide a more structured and intuitive way to write asynchronous code compared to using callbacks directly.
Promises simplify the handling of asynchronous operations by allowing chaining, error handling, and providing a more linear flow of code execution.

A Promise can have three states:

1. Pending: The initial state when the Promise is created, and the asynchronous operation is still in progress.
2. Fulfilled: The state when the asynchronous operation is successfully completed, and the Promise is resolved with a value.
3. Rejected: The state when the asynchronous operation encounters an error or fails, and the Promise is rejected with a reason or error.

Three important methods associated with Promises are:

1. then(): The then() method is used to handle the resolved value of a Promise. It takes two optional callback functions as arguments: onFulfilled and onRejected.
These callbacks are invoked when the Promise is fulfilled or rejected, respectively.
  
   someAsyncOperation()
     .then((result) => {
       // Handle the resolved value (result) here
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       // Handle any errors that occurred during the Promise execution
     });
 

2. catch(): The catch() method is used to handle any errors or rejections that occurred during the Promise execution.
It is similar to the onRejected callback passed to then(), but it specifically handles the rejection case.
 
   someAsyncOperation()
     .then((result) => {
       // Handle the resolved value (result) here
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       // Handle any errors that occurred during the Promise execution
     });
  

3. finally(): The finally() method is used to specify a callback that is always executed, regardless of whether the Promise is fulfilled or rejected.
It allows you to perform cleanup operations or any necessary tasks that need to be done regardless of the Promise's outcome.
  
   someAsyncOperation()
     .then((result) => {
       // Handle the resolved value (result) here
     })
     .catch((error) => {
       // Handle any errors that occurred during the Promise execution
     })
     .finally(() => {
       // Perform cleanup operations or other tasks here
     });
  
These Promise methods allow you to handle the resolution, rejection, and cleanup of asynchronous operations in a more structured manner.
They help in writing cleaner and more maintainable asynchronous code, reducing the reliance on deeply nested callbacks.

Q.7 What’s async & await Keyword in JavaScript
The async and await keywords in JavaScript are used to simplify the handling of asynchronous code and make it appear more like synchronous code.
They are part of the ES2017 (ES8) specification and provide syntactic sugar on top of Promises.

1. async Keyword:
   - The async keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function. It allows the function to use the await keyword inside its body.
   - An async function always returns a Promise, which is resolved with the value returned by the function or rejected with an error thrown inside the function.
   - Example:
   
     async function fetchData() {
       // Asynchronous operations
       const result = await someAsyncOperation();
       return result;
     }
    
   - The async keyword allows you to write asynchronous code in a more linear and synchronous-looking manner.

2. await Keyword:
   - The await keyword can only be used inside an async function. It pauses the execution of the async function until the Promise is resolved or rejected.
   - The await keyword can be placed in front of a Promise, and it waits for that Promise to settle (either resolve or reject) and returns the resolved value.
   - Example:
     
     async function fetchData() {
       const result = await someAsyncOperation();
       // Code after await, executed after the Promise is resolved
       return result;
     }
  
   - The await keyword simplifies the consumption of Promises and allows you to write code that looks like synchronous code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

Using async and await together, you can write asynchronous code that resembles synchronous code in terms of structure and readability.
It avoids callback hell and simplifies error handling, as try...catch blocks can be used to catch and handle errors in the same way as synchronous code.

Q.8 Explain Purpose of Try and Catch Block & Why do we need it?
The try and catch blocks are used in JavaScript for error handling and are part of the language's exception handling mechanism. 
They allow you to handle and recover from errors that may occur during the execution of your code.
The purpose of try and catch blocks is to provide a structured way to handle and manage errors in a controlled manner.

try Block:
The try block contains the code that may potentially throw an error or raise an exception.
If an error occurs within the try block, the execution of the block is immediately halted, and the control is transferred to the corresponding catch block.

catch Block:
The catch block is responsible for catching and handling any errors that occur within the corresponding try block.
The catch block takes an error object as its parameter, which represents the error thrown in the try block.

Example:
try {
  // Code that may throw an error
} catch (error) {
  // Code to handle the error
}

Need:
-Error Handling
-Error Recovery
-Code Resilience
-Debugging and Logging

Q.9 Explain fetch
The fetch() function is a modern JavaScript API used for making HTTP requests and retrieving resources from a network.
It provides a more powerful and flexible alternative to the traditional XMLHttpRequest object for fetching data asynchronously.
SYNTAX:
fetch(url)
  .then((response) => {
    // Handle the response
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle any errors
  });

-url (required): The URL of the resource you want to fetch.
-The fetch() function returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object representing the response to the request.
-The response can be handled using the .then() method, which takes a callback function that receives the Response object.
-The .catch() method is used to handle any errors that occur during the request or response handling.
The fetch() function supports various options and configurations to customize the request, such as specifying request headers, HTTP methods, authentication, and more.
It can be used to fetch different types of data, including JSON, text, blobs, and more.

###############################################################################################
Q.10 How do you define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using async/await?
The async keyword before the function declaration tells JavaScript that the function will use await to handle asynchronous operations within its body.
Example:
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    if (response.ok) {
      const data = await response.json();
      console.log(data);
    } else {
      throw new Error('Request failed');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
In the example above, the fetchData function is declared as an asynchronous function using the async keyword. 
It makes use of await to pause the execution at the respective statements until the Promises are resolved. This allows for a more synchronous-like flow of code execution within the asynchronous function.
